    | ZeepZoop is proudly one of the fewest online shopping guides for jewellery in India. We believe Jewellery is an integral part of fashion as 
    | it transcends the meaning of fashion in a way. Wearing Jewellery is an extension of oneâ€™s cultural and individualistic identity. To adorn 
    | oneself with ornamental jewellery is instinctual and innate in us. We have stuck gemstones in rare metals and worn them to display social 
    | statuses, emotions like mourning, love, etc, to simply showcase love for art and to sometimes for protection in the form of amulets.

    | Our jewellery buying guide endorses the culture of expressing oneself through pieces of well-crafted jewellery as well as promotes brands by 
    | luxury jewellery designers that design conceptualized, thoughtful, hand-made, Indian jewellery, rather than mass-produced, random pieces of 
    | moulded metals.
